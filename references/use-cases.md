## Tips for Writing Good Task Descriptions

### Be Specific
- Name exact folders and files
- Describe desired output format
- Specify any constraints

### Provide Context
- What's the purpose of the task?
- Any preferences or standards to follow?
- Expected timeline or priority?

### Include Examples
- Sample output if available
- Naming conventions to follow
- Formatting preferences

### Break Down Complex Tasks
Instead of:
> "Organize everything"

Try:
> "First, sort documents by type. Then, create a dated folder structure. Finally, move files to appropriate folders."
