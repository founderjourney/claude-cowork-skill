# Getting Started with Cowork

## Prerequisites

Before using Cowork, ensure you have:

1. **Claude Desktop app** installed (macOS only currently)
2. **Claude Max subscription** active
3. **Active internet connection**

## Accessing Cowork

1. Open the **Claude Desktop** application
2. Look for the **mode selector** in the interface
3. Click on the **Cowork tab**
4. You'll switch to **"Tasks" mode**

## Your First Task

### Step 1: Choose a Folder
Select a folder on your computer that Claude can access. This is your "workspace" for Cowork tasks.

### Step 2: Describe Your Task
Be specific about what you want Claude to accomplish. Good examples:

**Good:**
> "Organize all the PDF files in my Documents/Invoices folder by year, creating subfolders for 2023, 2024, and 2025"

**Less Good:**
> "Clean up my files"

### Step 3: Let Claude Work
Once you assign a task:
- Claude will make a plan
- Show you progress updates
- Complete the work independently
- Notify you when done

## Tips for Success

### Be Specific
The more detail you provide, the better the results:
- Specify file types
- Describe desired organization
- Mention any naming conventions

### Start Small
Begin with simple tasks to understand how Cowork operates before tackling complex workflows.

### Keep the App Open
Cowork requires Claude Desktop to remain open during task execution.

### Review Outputs
Always review Claude's work, especially for tasks involving data manipulation or document creation.

## Common First Tasks

1. **File sorting** - Organize downloads by type or date
2. **Data extraction** - Pull information from multiple files into a spreadsheet
3. **Document drafting** - Create reports from notes or research
4. **Batch renaming** - Rename files following a pattern

## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Starting
- Ensure you're in Tasks mode (not regular chat)
- Check your Max subscription status
- Verify internet connection

### Can't Access Files
- Confirm you've granted folder access
- Check file permissions

### Task Taking Too Long
- Complex tasks may take time
- Check progress updates
- Consider breaking into smaller tasks

## Next Steps

Once comfortable with basics:
- Explore **Connectors** for external data
- Try **parallel task queuing**
- Use **Skills** for professional documents
