# Getting Started with Cowork

> **Research Preview**: Cowork is not production-ready. Use with caution and follow security best practices.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **App** | Claude Desktop (macOS only) |
| **Subscription** | Claude Max ($100 or $200/month) |
| **Connection** | Active internet required |

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Open Claude Desktop

Launch the Claude Desktop application on your Mac.

### 2. Find the Mode Selector

Look for the mode selector in the interface - this lets you switch between regular chat and Cowork.

### 3. Switch to Cowork/Tasks Mode

Click on the **Cowork tab** or **Tasks mode** option.

### 4. Designate a Folder

Select a folder on your computer that Claude can access.

**Important**: Only grant access to folders with non-sensitive files.

### 5. Assign Your First Task

Start with something simple and low-risk:

```
"List all files in this folder and tell me what you see"
```

## Your First Real Task

Once comfortable, try a simple organization task:

```
"Sort the files in this folder by file type into subfolders"
```

## Safety Checklist

Before using Cowork:

- [ ] Back up any important files in the folder
- [ ] Remove sensitive files (passwords, keys, credentials)
- [ ] Start with read-only tasks to test
- [ ] Use clear, unambiguous language

## What to Expect

1. Claude will analyze your request
2. You'll see progress updates
3. The app must stay open during execution
4. Results appear in your designated folder

## If Something Goes Wrong

- Tasks stop if you close the app
- You can interrupt by closing Claude Desktop
- Always have backups of important files
- Report issues to Anthropic (research preview feedback)

## Next Steps

After getting comfortable:

1. Try file organization tasks
2. Test content analysis
3. Experiment with multi-step tasks
4. Provide feedback to help improve the feature
